- Basic simulation
  -- Display population on the screen - OK
  -- Persons can move - OK

  -- Extract the simulation part into a backend which would communicate via WebSockets with frontend

  -- Some fixed number of persons are infected in the beginning and move, different color
  -- Separate the code into modules/introduce a module bundler?
  -- After a certain time an infected person becomes contagious
  -- With a certain probability contagious person can become accute
  -- After a certain amount of time elapses with a certain probability person can recover and become immune
  -- When person becomes accute with a certain probability a person can become dead
  -- Disease gets transferred to healthy encountered persons from contagious persons with a certain probability
  -- After a certain amount of time elapses immune person might loose immunity with a certain probability and will become healthy

- Use core.js or Underscore.js
- Display charts with the statistics about the development of the situation real-time
- Make simulation parameters configurable, enable simulation restart
- Record the history of the simulation/make the simulation replayable

- Simulate different scenarios:
  -- Very infectious disease which is quite mild
  -- Disease which is less infectious (harder to transmit), but is serious
  -- Simulate the effect of population density
  -- Simulate the effect of quarantining and isolating the infected persons (one parameter - probability that an infected person is found after each step of a simulation)
  -- Simulate the effect of quarantining the potentially infected persons (those whom the infected person encountered) (probability based discovery)
  -- Simulate the effect of movement restrictions when persons move only around a very small area around them, simulate not all the persons following the guidelines
  -- Simulate the effect of the immunity:
    -- no immunity against a disease is possible
    -- short lived immunity against the disease
    -- medium immunity against the disease
    -- long term immunity against the disease

- More simulations
  -- Simulate different age groups and separate disease parameters in them

- Questions:

  -- What is the maximum speed at which the disease would not spread anymore: i.e. R0 less that 1, sick people would recover faster than would transmit disease
