- Basic simulation
  -- Display population on the screen
  -- Persons can move
  -- Some fixed number of persons are infected in the beginning and move, different color
  -- After a certain time a sick person becomes contagious
  -- Disease gets transferred to healthy encountered persons from contagious persons with a certain probability

- Use core.js or Underscore.js
- Display charts with the statistics about the development of the situation real-time
- Make simulation parameters configurable, enable simulation restart
- Record the history of the simulation/make the simulation replayable

- Simulate different scenarios:
  -- Very infectious disease which is quite mild
  -- Disease which is less infectious (harder to transmit), but is serious
  -- Simulate the effect of population density
  -- Simulate the effect of quarantining and isolating the infected persons (one parameter - probability that an infected person is found after each step of a simulation)
  -- Simulate the effect of the immunity:
    -- no immunity against a disease is possible
    -- short lived immunity against the disease
    -- medium immunity against the disease
    -- long term immunity against the disease

- More simulations
  -- Simulate different age groups and separate disease parameters in them
